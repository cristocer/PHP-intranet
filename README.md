# PHP-intranet
sustudent.php is the file to be open in a browser. This can be done by running a Mysql and Apache server using Xampp or Wampp. Then you can navigate to localhost and open the file. For Xampp: the php file needs to be copied in the htdocs folder and the the other files in the mysql/bin folder.
